# lisatusberg.github.io
In order for you to publish html web pages and have GitHub working as a web server - you need to name this repository as username.github.io (where username is YOUR USERNAME - the one you created when you set up your GitHub account - OTHERWISE it will not work.
You will type username.github.io (where username is EXACTLY YOUR USERNAME - and you will also check the box
INITIALIZE THIS REPOSITRY WITH A README
and then you will click on the GREEN BUTTON that says CREATE REPOSITORY.

AFTER YOU UPLOAD YOUR FILES - index.html, about.html, etc....
you can open any browser and type https://username.github.io/index.html
or for me, https://lisatusberg.github.io/index.html
