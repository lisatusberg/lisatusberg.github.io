# lisatusberg.github.io

IN ORDER FOR YOU TO PUBLISH HTML PAGES AND HAVE GITHUB WORKING AS A WEB SERVER:

STEP 1. - You need to name this repository as username.github.io (where username is YOUR USERNAME)
the one you created when you set up your GitHub account - OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK!!!!!!!!

STEP 2. - You will type username.github.io (where username is EXACTLY YOUR USERNAME) - name your new repository your exact username

STEP 3. - and you will also check the box INITIALIZE THIS REPOSITORY WITH A README

STEP 4. - and then you will click on the GREEN BUTTON that says CREATE REPOSITORY.

STEP 5. - AFTER YOU UPLOAD YOUR FILES - index.html, about.html, etc....
you can open any browser and type https://username.github.io/index.html

or for me, https://lisatusberg.github.io/index.html
